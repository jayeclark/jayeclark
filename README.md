# Jay Clark

Hello world, I’m @jayeclark, and I started training to be a full stack software engineer in May 2021. You can see more of my work by browsing my [repositories](https://github.com/jayeclark?tab=repositories), viewing my [Portfolio](https://jayeclark.github.io) or exploring my work-in-progress react apps like my [Front End Toggler](https://jayeclark.github.io/front-end/) and my [Bad Bank App](https://jayeclark.github.io/banking). 

## Contributing
I'm interested in contributing to projects on a volunteer basis. I'm specifically looking to become more familiar with version control and with the project management tools that I might be expected to use in a developer role, especially JIRA. I have a talent and tenacity for debugging, refactoring, and self-commenting code that I am eager to contribute to the open source community.
