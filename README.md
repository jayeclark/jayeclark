## Contributing
I'm very interested in contributing to projects on a volunteer or part time contract basis, preferably JavaScript-heavy or backend-heavy work.

## My Tech Journey
### Version 1.0 : Harvard, Here I Come  
I studied medical ethics at Harvard and wrote my undergraduate thesis on how online forum participants debated news about Dolly, the cloned sheep.   
    
### Version 1.1 : Doctor Doctor   
I stayed at Harvard and earned a PhD. My work focused on how patients with rare diseases attempted to raise the perceived importance of their illness among government agencies, by establishing new kinship relationships between their rare disease and other, more 'important' diseases.  
   
### Version 2.0 : California Dreamin
After my PhD, I moved to sunny San Diego (no more snow!) and worked as a consultant at an award-winning government relations firm. My favorite project involved developing a dispatch & GPS tracking web app to help a major airport shuttle business comply with new regulations.   
   
### Version 2.1 : Startup Life   
I served as COO of a talent management agency for Twitch streamers that was featured in the New Yorker's 2017 tech issue. I was the sole developer working on the CRM that ran the business, and managed a small tech team as well. I wrote more than 50,000 lines of code to adapt it to our unique needs.
  
### Version 3.0 : Work in Progress
The talent management agency I worked for shut down three months into the pandemic. I started searching for a full time job in software development, but soon realized there were gaps in my technical knowledge from my years as a solo developer using older/obscure technologies, and they would likely make it more difficult for me to ramp up quickly in a new role. I rented out my house, hit the road as a digital nomad (new experiences are the PERFECT backdrop for learning), and embarked on a 12-month training program of self study accompanied and four professional certificates: [Intro to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x), [Full-stack Web Development](https://xpro.mit.edu/programs/program-v1:xPRO+PCCx+R1/), [Data Science](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science), and [Machine Learning](https://learn-xpro.mit.edu/machine-learning).
