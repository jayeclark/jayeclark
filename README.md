## Personal Projects (Just for Fun!)
If you'd like to see my work as part of a team of developers, along with my communication & leadership skills, check out the ParetOs [website](https://www.paret0.com) and [repository](https://github.com/mikhael28/paretOS/). It's a small project and very much in 'alpha' state, but it's a great group of people!   
   
Some of my older personal projects are below. They're primarily for front-end practice or for testing out or learning new stacks and frameworks.

## Contributing
I'm interested in contributing to projects on a volunteer or part time contract basis, preferably JavaScript-heavy or backend-heavy work.

## My Tech Journey
### Version 1.0 : Harvard, Here I Come  
I studied medical ethics at Harvard and wrote my undergraduate thesis on how online forum participants debated news about Dolly, the cloned sheep.   
    
### Version 1.1 : Doctor Doctor   
I stayed at Harvard and earned a PhD. My work focused on how patients with rare diseases attempted to raise the perceived importance of their illness among government agencies, by establishing new kinship relationships between their rare disease and other, more 'important' diseases - and how the internet rapidly expanded the tools they had available to make those connections.  
   
### Version 2.0 : California Dreamin & Learning to Code
After my PhD, I moved to sunny San Diego (no more snow!) and worked as a consultant at an award-winning government relations firm. My favorite project involved teaching myself to code, so that I could develop a dispatch & GPS tracking web app to help a major airport shuttle business comply with new regulations. I am still so impressed that tiny GPS devices made in South Africa and installed in cars in San Diego could send messages TO SPACE and then to a Czech company that sent them to my Chicago-hosted web app and onto the end-user devices of airport shuttle staff - all in just a few seconds.
   
### Version 2.1 : Startup Life   
I served as COO of a talent management agency for Twitch streamers that was featured in the New Yorker's 2017 tech issue. I was the sole developer working on extending and customizing the CRM that ran the business (think: Salesforce developer), and managed a small tech team that built an analytics platform that ingested all Twitch broadcast data and used it to make predictions about broadcaster growth and sponsored content timing & prices. 
  
### Version 3.0 : Back to School to Fill in the Gaps
The talent management agency I'd co-founded shut down three months into the pandemic. It took six months to fully wrap up and close out operations and settle what debts could be settled. Once that was completed, I started searching for a full time job in software development. But I soon realized there were gaps in my technical knowledge from my years using older/obscure technologies, and while my team and I had used many of the concepts of modern development (agile, version control, testing, ci/cd), we weren't using the most well known tools that companies would want to see experience in. I rented out my house, hit the road as a digital nomad (new experiences are the PERFECT backdrop for learning), and committed to a re-training program of self study using open courseware in CS and Math, plus two paid professional certificates: [Full-stack Web Development](https://xpro.mit.edu/programs/program-v1:xPRO+PCCx+R1/), and [Machine Learning](https://learn-xpro.mit.edu/machine-learning).   
 
### Version 4.0 : Day 1
Toward the end of my self-study, a recruiter from Amazon reached out! After an online assessment and six rounds of interviews, I received an offer to join the Amazon Fresh team as a Software Development Engineer working in post-order telemetry (big data, machine learning, event platforms, and anomaly detection.) I accepted, and joined the team in summer 2022.
