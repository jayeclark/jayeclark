# Jay Clark

Hello world, I’m @jayeclark, and I've been training to be a full stack software engineer since May 2021, focusing on the MERN stack to start. At the moment, I'm working on making sure I have a strong grasp of JavaScript fundamentals. I've been active on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/jayclark) since July 2021, and I participate on Leetcode some as well.

## Contributing
I'm interested in contributing to projects on a volunteer basis. I'm specifically looking become more familiar with version control and with the project management tools that I might be expected to use in a developer role, especially JIRA. I have a talent for debugging and refactoring that I am eager to contribute to the right team.

## Version History

**Version 3.0: Work in Progress**  
When the pandemic put my executive job on pause, I reflected on my past roles - none of which were quite the right fit - and decided to consider a fresh start in a new industry. In May 2021, after realizing I'd felt most fulfilled (and most useful) working on web apps to solve business problems, I took the humbling step of completely rebooting my career, starting over from scratch to learn development the right way. For years, friends & family had told me I was too old to be able to catch up, that it was too difficult, or that I wouldn't enjoy it. As I hope my portfolio (coming soon) will demonstrate, they were wrong.

**Version 2.1: Startup Life**  
My partner, a game industry executive, saw that Twitch streamers needed help running their businesses, especially on paid collaborations with publishers and brands. As COO, I grew that observation from an idea into a renowned talent management business that was covered in the New Yorker and CNN. Though the venture did not survive the pandemic, I'm grateful for the experience - and especially grateful that our displaced employees all found new roles quickly. 

**Version 2.0: California Dreamin**  
I moved to San Diego and worked as an analyst for an award-winning consulting firm. While there, I designed and built a web app for real-time GPS tracking, reservation processing, and dispatch of a fleet of several dozen airport shuttles - an app that was somehow, against all odds, successfully kludged together from WordPress components and custom PHP snippets.

**Version 1.1: Doctor Doctor**  
I pursued a doctorate because I was planning in a career in academia. During the doctorate, I worked for Harvard's Program in Health Systems Improvement where I built a content management system for drafting, approving, and distributing monthly newsletters. My doctoral training trained me to teach and mentor others, to seek out new information and quickly build competence in new technical topics, and to work smarter, not harder - all skills that I bring to my coding today. Along the way, I realized that academia wasn't the path for me - increasing job scarcity meant I'd have little choice of where in the country my career would take me.

**Version 1.0: Harvard, Here I Come**  
I landed a spot at one of the most highly selective and respected universities. To pay for my degree, I worked in marketing at a start-up ERP software developer while a full time student. My Hoopes Prize-nominated thesis on internet culture led me to be accepted to Harvard's History of Science department as a PhD candidate. I took a gap year before the PhD to work in Corporate Strategy at a nonprofit biotech.

## Favorite Javascript Shortcuts
These are some of the favorite shortcuts I've come across for use in competitive programming and sites like Codewars & Leetcode.

**Ternary Operator**  
```javascript
// To save time & space in if/else blocks, use
let y = condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse

// instead of 
let y = '';
if (condition) { 
  y = expressionIfTrue;
} else { 
  y = expressionIfFalse;
}

// Keep in mind that this ternary operator format only works for single-line values or expressions. 
// If you want to do something more complicated, you'll have to write a helper function. 
// But the result is still likely to be easier to read and take up fewer lines of code. 
```

**String Spread Operator**  

```javascript 
// To create an array out of each letter in a string, use
let arr = [...str]

// instead of 
let arr = str.split('')
```
**+ Operator**  
```javascript
// To return the numeric representation of an object or variable, use
+[...'1234.56'].reverse().join('')

//instead of 
parseFloat([...'1234.56'].reverse().join(''))
```
