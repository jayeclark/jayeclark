# Jay Clark

Hello world, I’m @jayeclark, and I've been training to be a full stack software engineer since May 2021, focusing on the MERN stack to start. At the moment, I'm working on making sure I have a strong grasp of JavaScript fundamentals. I've been active on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/jayclark) since July 2021, and I participate on Leetcode some as well.

## Contributing
I would love to contribute to projects on a volunteer basis. I'm specifically looking become more familiar with version control and with the project management tools that I might be expected to use in a developer role, especially JIRA. I have a talent for debugging and refactoring that I am eager to contribute to the right team.

## Version History

**Version 4.0 - In process**  
When the pandemic put my executive job on pause, I reflected on my past roles - none of which were the best fit - and decided to consider a fresh start in a new industry. In May 2021, after realizing I'd felt most fulfilled (and most useful) working on web apps to solve business problems, I took the humbling step of completely rebooting my career, starting over from scratch to learn development the right way. For years, friends & family had told me I was too old to be able to catch up, that it was too difficult, or that I wouldn't enjoy it. As I hope my portfolio (coming soon) will demonstrate, they were wrong.

**Version 3.1: Startup Life**  
My partner, a game industry exec, saw that Twitch streamers needed help running their businesses, especially on paid collaborations with publishers and brands. As COO, I grew that observation from an idea into a renowned talent management business that was covered in the New Yorker, the New York Times and CNN. Though the venture did not survive the pandemic, I'm grateful for the experience - and for the fact that our displaced employees all found new roles quickly. I enjoyed my technical side-projects (coding custom functions and integrations) the most, and learned that I perform better as a member of a team of equals at a larger organization, rather than as an executive at a small company.

**Version 3.0: California Dreamin'**  
I moved to the beach in San Diego and worked as an analyst for an award-winning consulting firm. While there, I designed and built a web app for real-time GPS tracking, reservation processing, and dispatch of a fleet of several dozen airport shuttles - an app that was somehow, against all odds, successfully kludged together from WordPress components and custom PHP snippets.

**Version 2.1: Flip that House**  
My father was a contractor, so it seemed only natural for construction & remodeling to be my PhD 'side hustle.' I started a construction & real estate development business that gave me the financial freedom to escape to Southern California during the bitter Cambridge winters. Along the way, I realized that university administration and academia wasn't a path I wanted to continue following, the job scarcity meant that I'd have very little choice of where in the country my career would take me.

**Version 2.0: Doctor Doctor**  
I pursued a doctoral degree because I was planning in a career in academia & university administration. Early in my studies, I worked for the Program in Health Systems Improvement where I built a content management system for drafting, approving, and distributing monthly newsletters to stakeholders. My doctoral training taught me how to teach and mentor others, how to seek out new information and quickly build competence in new technical topics, and how to work smarter, not harder - all skills that I bring to my coding today.

**Version 1.0: Harvard, Here I Come**  
I was fortunate to land a slot at one of the most highly selective and most respected universities. To pay for my degree and avoid student loans, I worked in marketing at a start-up ERP software developer while also a full time student. My Hoopes Prize-nominated thesis on internet culture led me to apply and be accepted to Harvard's History of Science department as a PhD candidate. I took a gap year after graduation to work in Corporate Strategy at a nonprofit biotech.

## Favorite Javascript Shortcuts
These are some of the favorite shortcuts I've come across for use in competitive programming and sites like Codewars & Leetcode.

**Ternary Operator**  
```javascript
// To save time & space in if/else blocks, use
let y = condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse

// instead of 
let y = '';
if (condition) { 
   expressionIfTrue 
} else { 
   expressionIfFalse 
}

// Keep in mind that this ternary operator format only works for single-line values or expressions. 
// If you want to do something more complicated, you'll have to write a helper function. 
// But the result is still likely to be easier to read and take up fewer lines of code. 
```

**String Spread Operator**  

```javascript 
// To create an array out of each letter in a string, use
let arr = [...str]

// instead of 
let arr = str.split('')
```
**+ Operator**. 
```javascript
// To return the numeric representation of an object or variable, use
+[...'1234.56'].reverse().join('')

//instead of 
parseFloat([...'1234.56'].reverse().join(''))
```
