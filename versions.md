### Version 3.0 : Work in Progress  
When the pandemic put my executive job on pause, I reflected on my past roles - none of which had been quite the right fit. I'd spent my early career choosing the easiest and most convenient option, instead of seeking out the right role and industry and putting in effort to work toward that goal. I started to give serious, deep thought to what that 'right' industry and role might be, and realized I'd felt most fulfilled (and most useful) applying technology to solve business problems. 

In May 2021, I took the humbling step of completely rebooting my career, starting over from scratch as a software engineer. For years, friends & family told me I was too old to be able to catch up, that it was too difficult, or that I wouldn't enjoy it. As I hope my portfolio (coming soon) will demonstrate, they were wrong.
  
### Version 2.1 : Startup Life  
My partner, a game industry executive, saw that Twitch streamers needed help running their businesses, especially on paid collaborations with publishers and brands. As COO, I grew that observation from an idea into a renowned talent management business that was covered in the New Yorker and CNN. I coded more than 160 custom functions for our CRM system that automated daily tasks, provided insights into business bottlenecks, auto-generated contracts, and used APIs to integrate with Google Calendar, QuickBooks Online, and Docusign. 

Though the venture did not survive the pandemic, I'm grateful for the experience - and especially grateful that when the business shuttered, our displaced employees all found new roles quickly. 
  
### Version 2.0 : California Dreamin  
I moved to San Diego and worked as an analyst for an award-winning consulting firm. While there, I designed and built a web app for real-time GPS tracking, reservation processing, and dispatch of a fleet of several dozen airport shuttles - an app that was somehow, against all odds, successfully kludged together from WordPress components and custom PHP snippets.
  
### Version 1.1 : Doctor Doctor  
I pursued a doctorate because I was interested in a career in academia, where I would constantly be learning new things and mentoring younger academics. During the PhD, I worked for Harvard's Program in Health Systems Improvement where I built a content management system for drafting, approving, and distributing monthly newsletters. My doctoral training taught me to teach and mentor others, to seek out new information and quickly build competence in new technical topics, and to work smarter, not harder - all skills that I bring to my coding today. 

Along the way, I realized that academia wasn't the path for me. Job scarcity meant I'd have little choice of where in the country my career would take me, and I wanted to live somewhere without winter.
  
### Version 1.0 : Harvard, Here I Come  
I landed a spot at one of the most highly selective and respected universities. To pay for my degree, I worked in marketing at a start-up ERP software developer while a full time student. My Hoopes Prize-nominated thesis on internet culture led me to be accepted to Harvard's History of Science PhD program. 

I took a gap year before my PhD to work in Corporate Strategy at a nonprofit biotech.
